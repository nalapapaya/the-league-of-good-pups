# The League of Good Pups

The League of Good Pups is a React app where you get to build your ultimate team of dog breeds. Each pup brings its own unique stats, from temperament to lifespan and more. You can browse detailed breed info, add pups to your pack, and see how different combos change your team‚Äôs stats. There‚Äôs no rulebook, it‚Äôs up to you to figure out what makes the perfect squad. Your team is saved with Airtable, so you can come back and keep tweaking your dream pack anytime!

## A Friendly Fact to Start With

## Evolving Team Stats

Start by adding your first pup to the team! The chart will come alive with their stats!

Add another‚Ä¶ and uh-oh, synergy dropped! Turns out more pups = more chaos. Choose wisely!

Want to experiment? Try editing a dog‚Äôs height and weight and watch the stats magically shift.
